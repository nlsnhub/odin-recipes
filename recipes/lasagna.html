<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish that consists of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with fillings such as meat, cheese, and tomato sauce. The dish is typically baked in the oven, allowing the ingredients to meld together, creating a rich and hearty meal.</p>
<p>The flavor of lasagna is a delightful blend of savory and slightly tangy from the tomato sauce, combined with the creamy richness of the cheese and the satisfying texture of the pasta.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Meat(Ground beef)</li>
    <li>Onions</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Pasta Sheets</li>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cook the pasta sheets according to package instructions. Brown the ground meat in a skillet, then add tomato sauce and seasonings. Prepare the béchamel or ricotta cheese mixture.</li>
    <li>In a baking dish, start with a layer of meat sauce, followed by a layer of pasta sheets. Add a layer of cheese (ricotta or béchamel), then repeat the layers until the dish is full, ending with a layer of sauce and a generous topping of shredded cheese.</li>
    <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 25-30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes to allow the cheese on top to become golden and bubbly.</li>
    <li>After baking, let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes to set, then slice and serve.</li>
