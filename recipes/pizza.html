<h2>Description</h2>
<p id="description">Pizza is a popular Italian dish that consists of a round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with a variety of ingredients, typically including tomato sauce, cheese, and a selection of meats, vegetables, and seasonings. The dough is usually rolled out thin for a crispy crust or left thicker for a chewier texture. Once assembled, the pizza is baked in an oven until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly. The flavor of pizza varies widely depending on the toppings, ranging from savory and rich with combinations like pepperoni and mozzarella, to fresh and light with options like tomatoes, basil, and olive oil. Pizza’s versatility makes it a favorite worldwide, with countless regional variations and styles, such as the classic Neapolitan, deep-dish Chicago, and New York-style thin crust. Its balance of simple ingredients and complex flavors has made pizza an enduring and beloved dish across cultures.</p>
